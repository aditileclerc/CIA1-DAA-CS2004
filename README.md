**Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra's, Prim's, and Kruskal's
**
This repository contains implementations of three fundamental graph algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm, and Kruskal's Algorithm. Additionally, it includes a detailed comparison report analyzing the performance and use cases of these algorithms.

Graph algorithms are essential for solving problems related to shortest paths, minimum spanning trees, and graph traversal. This repository implements the following:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

Prim's Algorithm: Constructs a minimum spanning tree (MST) by adding edges with the lowest weight.

Kruskal's Algorithm: Constructs a minimum spanning tree by sorting edges and using a union-find data structure.
