It is a greedy algorithm. It starts with an empty spanning tree. The idea
is to maintain two sets of vertices. The first set contains the vertices already included in the
MST; the other set contains the vertices not yet included. At every step, it considers all the
edges that connect the two sets and picks the minimum weight edge from these edges. After
picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST.


prims algoithim will  not work for a directed graph as Prim’s algorithm assumes that all vertices are connected. 
But in a directed graph, every node is not reachable from every other node. So, Prim’s algorithm fails due to this reason.
